The health of citizens plays a major role in measuring the development of a nation. India, being a developing country, is of utmost importance for the government to identify the major lifestyle diseases people are suffering from such as diabetes, hypertension, anemia, etc. Therefore, creating the need to spread awareness and adopt necessary measures to reduce them. Based on the information collected on the nutritional status of people living in the EAG States (namely Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Assam), we try to identify whether the people are suffering from lifestyle diseases or not and if yes, then what are the contributing factors, what can be done to reduce them, and what have been the trends of lifestyle diseases in the EAG States in the last few years.
